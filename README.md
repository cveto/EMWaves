## Electromagnetic Wave Simulator

This is a one-file only HTML/Javascript (pure)/CSS simulator of visible light. It's capable of simulating some simple signal propeties.
I's purpose was to try visuakiting negative group velocity. Works best in Opera and Chrome, has some performacne issues with Mozzilla.

Need a semi-powerful computer to run this as code isn't fully optimized.
